<div  style="grid-area: 1 / 1; font-size: 0.7em;">

- Open Source Software (OSS) is everywhere
  - It is a foundation for all modern software development​
  - In Equinor we develop OSS. </br>([Open Source in Equinor](https://opensource.app.radix.equinor.com/))
  - OSS typically represent 80%+ of all code in system developed by Equinor - and by our vendors
    - That is code we have not developed our self
    - More code means more vulnerabilities!
- All software is a living organism
  - All software needs regular TLC (Tender, Love, Care)
  - Code and dependencies MUST be kept up-to-date
  - Snyk will assist in identifying known vulnerability of OSS libraries

Note:
- A side note: It’s not about if your are hacked, it’s when. How you handle the incident is important. Hydro was transparent – and handled their crisis good. No real loss in reputation, rather the opposite.
